The CodeAlpha internship program offers valuable opportunities for both students and professionals to gain hands-on experience in the fields of data science, machine learning, and software development.

# Internship Tasks:
As a CodeAlpha intern, my assignments spanned diverse projects, including  Titanic classification,stock prediction, and A/B testing analysis. These tasks allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing my practical understanding of the concepts.

# Learning Experience:
Throughout the internship, I acquired valuable experience in essential areas such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation techniques, and result interpretation. This immersive experience significantly deepened my comprehension of data science principles.

# Acknowledgments:
I express my sincere gratitude to the mentors and colleagues at CodeAlpha for their continuous guidance, support, and encouragement, which played a pivotal role in shaping my learning journey during the internship.

# Task-1: Titanic Classification

# Overview:
Titanic classification involves predicting whether a passenger survived or perished in the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and cabin location.

# Approach:
Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines (SVM), were employed to classify passengers into survived or not survived categories.

# Data:
The analysis utilized the renowned Titanic dataset, encompassing information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including survival outcomes.

# Results:
Performance evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were employed to assess the effectiveness of the classification model in predicting survival outcomes.

# Usage:
Users can input passenger information and execute the provided code to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster, with train.csv for model building and test.csv for predictions.

# Task-2: Stock Prediction

# Overview:
Stock prediction involves leveraging historical data and various algorithms, such as linear regression, random forest, or LSTM neural networks, to forecast future stock prices. This is crucial for making informed decisions in the financial domain.

# Approach:
The approach included the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock data, considering factors like stock prices, trading volumes, financial ratios, and other relevant indicators.

# Data:
Utilizing historical stock data from reputable financial data providers or APIs, we compiled information crucial for accurate stock predictions.

# Results:
The stock prediction model demonstrated a certain level of accuracy, evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or accuracy score.

# Usage:
The stock prediction model allows users to input historical data, facilitating the generation of predictions for future stock prices through the provided code.


# Task-3: A/B Testing Analysis

# Overview:
A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, app, or marketing strategy to determine which performs better in terms of a desired outcome.

# Data:
Data collected from users randomly assigned to the control group (version A) or the treatment group (version B) during the experiment formed the basis for the A/B testing analysis.

# Methodology:
Statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests or chi-square tests) or Bayesian inference, were employed to analyze A/B test results and determine statistically significant differences between the two versions.

# Results:
The analysis provided insights into the performance of versions A and B based on metrics like conversion rate, click-through rate, or revenue generated.

# Usage:
Users can conduct their own A/B testing analysis by following the provided instructions, inputting relevant data, and running the code, with cookie_cats.csv as the dataset used.
